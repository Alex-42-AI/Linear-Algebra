# Linear-Algebra
The file Vectors.py contains implementations of 2D and 3D vectors.The 2D vector is like a 3D vector with a z coordinate equal to zero, so Vector3D inherits from it.
The vectors have methods for:
1) getting the polar coordinates of the vector;
2) getting the dot product of two vectors;
3) checking whether two vectors are parallel;
4) checking whether two vectors are perpendicular;
5) getting the mixed product of three vectors;
6) getting the opposite vector of the given;
7) getting the length of the vector;
8) addition and subtraction of two vectors;
9) vector product of two vectors;
10) dividing the vector by a number.

The same methods are changed accordingly in the 3D vector.
